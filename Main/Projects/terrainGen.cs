//final project
//procedural generator
//uses random or input seed to create a map and then export as an ascii

// create main stuff
// create a two dimension array based on user input for size of map
// user input for proportions
possibly let user input seed that where each value determines what's in map

// set each value to whitespace
// function using vectors to change values in map along directions
// random start points along edges for mountains and hills.
// create mountains as general directions with a variable thickness
// then flank by hills on one or both sides based on chance
// River starts at mountains and change hills measure directions and then travel perpendicular
// lakes start at random river point and fill.
// place house with wall.
//
// print whole thing to .txt file.
